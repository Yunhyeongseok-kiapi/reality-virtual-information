### (KIAPI)Development of reality-virtual information convergence and edge-based autonomous driving simulation SW technology
Precision simulation SW and system linkage framework for co-simulation in conjunction with real (vehicle, PG environment, etc.) based on precise virtual environment-based sensing/cognitive/judgment or control information in line with the due diligence environment (vehicle, PG environment, etc.)

#### GOALS
- LoD4 -level autonomous driving mock test that supports precision textures static/dynamic asset content
- Virtual-Development of autonomous driving simulators and interfaces for edges for real information convergence verification
- Signal distortion, precision heterogeneous sensor modeling reflecting the attenuation
- Co-simulation framework linked car, artificial intelligence solution, edge server
- Test case for autonomous driving verification, scenario creation and verification
- Synthetic datuments for artificial intelligence and benchmark sites for performance verification
